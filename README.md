# 19C
EDF Deliverable references managing application using SQLite database

EDF Deliverable references - called "19 caract√®res" or 19C - must follow predefined rules fixed by EDF.
The 19C references end up by having a constant length of 19 characters.
This tool written in Python 3.0 aims to guide the user through the management of the 19C.
Its main functions are:
- Manage the communication with the SQLite database
- Create of a new 19C by completing a form made of lists and entry fields
- Consult the list of the existing 19C
- Export the list of the existing 19C
- Manage users of the tool

Important:
A configuration file named "config_db_path.txt" defines the path of the database.
Before the first execution, the path must match the database location.

Every time a user makes an export of the 19C list, the application generates a csv file which can be found into the subfolder .\export
